# zo:diac

zo:diac is a web app created for the [co:here Generative AI Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/generative-ai-hackathon). We use co:here's "/generate" endpoint to create individualized horoscopes for users. Upon receiving their horoscope, users can continue to query for additional guidance by providing topics.

You can try out zo:diac [here](https://zodiac.tarinyoom.io/).

You can see our pitch deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11RifjsheTmu4TUw6l7VzZbRRlgC0CZ5X4dlTr1ucWn8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Technologies Used

zo:diac uses Node.js and React with Material UI. Both frontend and backend are hosted on Cloudflare's serverless architecture. We rely on co:here's [generate](https://cohere.ai/generate) endpoint for token generation.
